# Ethereum Smart Contract Example

This repository contains a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. The smart contract demonstrates basic functionalities such as depositing and withdrawing ether.

## Contract Overview

The smart contract (`aramideContaract.sol`) consists of the following functionalities:

- `deposit`: Allows users to deposit ether into the contract.
- `withdraw`: Allows users to withdraw ether from the contract.
- `getBalance`: Allows users to retrieve their balance in the contract.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Install Node

3. Compile the smart contract using a Solidity compiler like `solc`, Truffle, or Hardhat.

4. Deploy the compiled smart contract to an Ethereum test network or a local blockchain.

5. Interact with the deployed contract using appropriate tools like Truffle console, Hardhat console, or a web3 provider.

## Testing
